      So far, given what we have in the Player.cpp and Player.h files,
      the following affect the base player value:
      1) Rating      (exponential)
      2) Age         (bell curve, peak when reached potential)
      3) Potential   (exponential)
      
      For young players (age<23), potential is weighed more heavily than overall.
      While players can grow even after they pass age 23, potential affects their
      value less and is not completely ignored.
      
      The same player may also be valued differently by different clubs.
