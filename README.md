Test Programs for the Soccer Management Game

These programs were created to test values and functions used in the soccer management game. For example, the growth rate of youth players needed a formula to test how quickly players' abilities would grow, and we needed a realistic rate. That program tests over the time period of a player's career how much experience he would gain.

To showcase my programming abilities, many of these programs will be written in languages other than C++, which is the language I used to create the functional game.
